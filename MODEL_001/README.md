# Model 001
This model is a test case designed to see whether the correct c-axis is determined for a given a/b ratio and density. In this case, the density of a given cell is set to 0. if the enthalpy is less than 0 and rho_0 if the enthalpy is greater than 0.

- Macroscopic output at each iteration is found in Data.txt
- Spatia-temporal density data (used to generate GIF) is found in Density.txt
